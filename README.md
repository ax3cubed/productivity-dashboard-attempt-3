## Overview

The Real-Time Productivity Dashboard is a Next.js application that helps users track, visualize, and optimize their productivity. It uses an enhanced Real-Time Productivity (RTP) algorithm that goes beyond simple task completion tracking to provide meaningful insights into work patterns, priorities, and efficiency.

## RTP Algorithm

### Original Formula

The original RTP algorithm used a simple weighted completion formula:


$RTP = (Σ Wi × Ci) / (Σ Wi × Ctotal) × 100$



Where:
- Wi: Weight assigned to task level i (LOW=1, MID=2, HIGH=3)
- Ci: Number of tasks completed in category i
- Ctotal: Total number of tasks in category i

Limitations of the original formula:
- Fixed weights for task priorities
- No consideration of task duration or complexity
- No adjustment for user workload or capacity
- No handling of task dependencies
- No time tracking integration
- No personalization based on user patterns

### Enhanced Formula

The enhanced RTP algorithm introduces a more sophisticated approach:


$RTP = (Σ DWi × Ci) / (Σ DWi × Ctotal) × 100$

Where:
- DWi: Dynamic weight for task i, calculated as:

$DWi = (Bp × Wp + Bu × Wu + Bc × Wc)/(Wp + Wu + Wc)$

With:
- Bp: Base priority weight (1-10 scale)
- Bu: Urgency factor based on deadline proximity and task duration
- Bc: Complexity factor based on subtasks, collaborators, etc.
- Wp, Wu, Wc: User preference weightings for priority, urgency, and complexity

### Optimization Changes

1. **Continuous Priority Scale (1-10)**
   - Replaced the simple LOW/MID/HIGH system with a nuanced 1-10 scale
   - Allows for more precise prioritization of tasks

2. **Contextual Deadline Handling**
   - Urgency calculation now considers the total task duration
   - Short tasks due soon are properly prioritized against longer tasks
   - Overdue tasks receive increasing priority based on how late they are

3. **Dynamic Weighting System**
   - Weights adjust based on multiple factors:
     - Task priority/type
     - Deadline proximity (contextual to task size)
     - User preferences
     - Task complexity (subtasks, collaborators)
     - Productive hours of the user

4. **Workload Balancing**
   - System tracks user capacity and current workload
   - Adjusts priorities when user is overloaded
   - Provides visibility into approaching deadlines

5. **Task Dependencies**
   - Tasks can be blocked by other tasks
   - Dependency relationships affect priority calculations
   - Blocked tasks are highlighted in the UI

6. **Time Tracking Integration**
   - Track both estimated and actual time spent
   - Calculate estimation accuracy metrics
   - Evaluate productivity based on time efficiency

7. **Quality Assessment**
   - Rate completed tasks on quality (1-5 stars)
   - Balance quantity and quality metrics
   - Track quality trends over time

8. **Personalization**
   - User preferences for productive hours
   - Preferred task types
   - Custom weighting preferences
